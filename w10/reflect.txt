Reflection

During this workshop, I learned several important concepts related to templates to create generic functions and classes, allowing them to work with different data types. In the searchNlist.h file, I implemented two template functions: listArrayElements and search. The first function lists the elements of an array of any type, and the second searches for a key value in an array and adds the results to a collection.
The ReadWrite class, on the other hand, is an abstract class with a pure virtual method display, which is overridden by the derived classes Car, Student and Employee. This demonstrates the use of polymorphism, where the appropriate function is called based on the type of the object at runtime.
- One of the main challenges was ensuring that the template functions worked correctly with different data types. This involved writing generic code and ensuring that all classes provided the necessary implementations of the virtual methods. Another challenge was memory management in the Collection class, especially when resizing the dynamic array without causing memory leaks. Overall, this workshop was an excellent opportunity to deepen my knowledge of templates, polymorphism and memory management.
